     The ultimate refined form of humanity and society rests within each individual, in the mind and soul. However, the visible and tangible embodiments of such an abstract concept are seen in what we build, construct, and create.

      Citizen Residence
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Residencial areas are scattered around the Civitate Futurium, usually built near private businesses and public areas. Most residences are in the form of apartments, as there is limited land in the city. Despite the slightly decreased living space in Civitate Futurium, the top floors of apartment towers offer breathtaking views of the industrial beuaty down below, and also vies of the warm, promising glow of the eastern sunrise.

The city's income is also 30% higher than any other American Union State City's income.
